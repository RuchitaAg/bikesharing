# Bikesharing Aba

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a proposal for bringing bike rentals to Des Moines, lowa using Tableau.


## Objective 

The analysis will help to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal below bike trip analysis is created for one of the key stakeholders.

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

**Tools and Technology** - Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Tableau Public



## Results
The following visualizations were created for the proposal and have notes below each of them.

**Starting Location**

The above visualization shows the locations of where bikes are checked out. The circle size and color correspond to the number of bikes checked out. These results show a higher amount of bike checkouts occuring in lower to mid Manhattan.

**Checkout Times by Users and Genders**

These two visualizations show the length of time for each bike rental as well as the number of rentals. The upper graph shows the total for all Genders, showing that the vast majority of rentals are less than 30 minutes. The lower visualization breaks down rental times by Gender. This shows that males are a much larger portion of the bike rentals, but the rental times are fairly equivalent between all Genders.


## 

**Customers by Type**

This visualization uses a pie chart to show the proportion of each User Type. This shows that over 80% of customers are Subscribers.


## 


**Trips by Gender Heatmap**

Here a heatmap has been used to show the concentration of trips by different hours of the day over a week. It is also grouped by Gender. Male and Female usage appears to occur most from 7-9AM and 4-8PM on weekdays, probably coinciding with daily work commutes.


## 

**Trips by Weekday Heatmap**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102870991/192191503-2e4b52a5-2bdc-4bdd-b306-4ab473dede86.png)


This heatmat is similar to the one before without breaking down usage by Gender. Again, this shows the most usuage during weekday commute hours

## 


**Trips by User and Gender Type Heatmap**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102870991/192191533-9c199378-c8e7-4b54-b79f-a33a3b4c6163.png)

This visualization also uses a heatmap, but breaksdown usage by User Type and Gender throughout the week. Here we can see Male Subscribers have a much higher concentration compared to the others.

## 


## Summary:

Based upon the visualizations above, we can see that the vast majority of usage comes from Subscribers that are Male using bikes during weekday commutes in the morning and evening.

**Additional visualizations could include showing which Stations correspond to the most amount of bike rentals. Also a visualization showing the age of the average customer compared to how long they rent a bike could be helpful.**
